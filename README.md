# Alexander
Alexander is a text annotation environment developed for the international Protagoras Society, it has had several rewrites over the years including:
- Early Flash based prototype, still TEI based.
- Java based local editor, abandoned due to distribution issues on Mac, named AleXML
- PHP, JS, CSS and HTML based Alexander 1.0, fully online.
- Alexander 2.0 (current iteration), based on PHP, JS, CSS3, HTML5 and SQLITE3. All round better
