Sedley (2003) 79: Trading on the semi-misquotation, Socrates secures Hermogenes' agreement that in cities men are wiser than women when one considers the two classes as a whole (392c). Although we may find this offensively sexist, note at least the pointed resemblance to Republic {italics} V 455d, where Socrates similarly maintains that taken as a class men are superior to women, but does so in the course of arguing that nevertheless many individual women are superior to many individual men, making this latter the basis for a radically egalitarian treatment of sexes in his ideal city. Here in the Cratylus {italics}, however, since Homer is assumed to have agreed that men are on the whole the wiser sex, Socrates infers that he must consider the nomenclature they choose the more correct.<img id="743" contenteditable="false" src="img/noteBut.png" title="id-743" class="annotation">
