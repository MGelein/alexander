Rademaker (2013) 99There is no indication that etymology as practiced systematically in the Cratylus {italics} was a central concern of Protagoras, but he probably did point out that the words as they are used in common language do not aways show a clear and unequivocal correspondence to the qualities of the things and entities to which they refer. Protagoras' criticism of feminine words referring to masculine things sems to point to a mismatch in this respect. This indicates that ὀρθοέπεια includes a concerne for the 'correct' use of individual words as attested in the 'linquitic' fragments, but it seems unlikely that this was Protagoras' only {italics} concern.<img id="730" contenteditable="false" src="img/noteBut.png" title="id-730" class="annotation">
