Rademaker (2013) 99 n. 30: As Fehling [(1965) 216, (1976) 345] points out, in the Carylus {italics}, Homer and the poets are mentioned as a second best authority on this ὀρθότης after Protagoras (391 C 10-D 1), and Protagoras is unlikely to have concerned himself with etymology more systematically than any of these poets. Closer perhaps to the concerns of the Cratylus (italics} is Prodicus, who is mentioned as an authority on ὀνομάτων ὀρθότης in Plato Euthyd. {italics} 277 E 4, which is explained as a concern for distinguishing subtle differences in te semantics of near-synonyms. Cp. Fehling [(1976) 346;] Brancacci [(2002) 180].
