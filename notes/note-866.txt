In this passage Protagoras is reported to have made the claim that if mênis {Italics} is masculine, it would be right to call mênis {italics} oulomenos {italics}, even though people would suppose that to be a grammatical error, and wrong to call mênis {Italics} oulomenê (italics}, even though th mistake would go unnoticed. This passage usually has been taken to mean that Protagoras claimed that the nouns μῆνις and πήληξ shoulsd in fact be masculine, on account of either the martial connotations of the words 'anger' and 'helmet' or their word endings. Thus, Protagoras signalled a discrepancy between word gender and biological gender that might be corrected by saying ὁ μῆνις or by giving the word an ending that is more unequivocally masculine; in doing so, he pointed to a putative mistake in the very first word of the Iliad {italics}<img id="867" contenteditable="false" src="img/fontBut.png" title="id-867" class="annotation">.
