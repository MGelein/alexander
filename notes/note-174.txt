Euripides... combusserunt: Of Eusebiusâ€™ Canon, a Latin translation by Hieronymus and an Armenian translation are preserved. The same information is given in Greek by Georgius Syncellus (Chronographica 471), who does not mention Eusebius, although it is very likely that Syncellys depends on Eusebius for his report.
