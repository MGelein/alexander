Sedley (2003) 78: Socrates half-remembers lines of Homer in which the alternative names of Hector's son are alluded to. He is citing Iliad {italics} XXII 506-7, where Andromache, addressing her recently fallen husband Hector, refers to their son as 'Astyanax, as the Trojans call him.' Socrates has remembered that the boy's alternative name was Scamandrius, but has forgotten that this is the name that Hector himself called him (VI 402-3). The lapse of memory leads him to the wrong inference, that the masculine noun 'Trojans' (Tr√¥es {italics}) refers to the male {italics} Trojans, as distinct from the Trojan women - not an altogether stupid guess, given that it is one of the Trojan women, Andromache, who is speaking. Thus Socrates mistakenly cites the passage as evidence that, according to Homer, the Trojan men and women differ in some of the nomenclature they use. Some might see this misreading as deliberate subversion on the part of Plato or Socrates. I cannot see what the point of the subversion should be, and assume rather that it is a simple error (whether on Socrates' part or on Plato's), encouraged by the desire to find differentiations between the competing names used in different groups.
