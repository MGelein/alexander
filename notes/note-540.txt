SOCR. Look at it this way. If you were asked who gives names more correctly, those who are wiser or those who are more foolish, what would you answer?
HERM. That it is clearly those who are wiser.
SOCR. And which class do you think is wiser on the whole, a city’s women or its men?
HERM. Its men.
SOCR. Now you know, don’t you, that Homer tells us that Hector’s son was called ‘Astyanax’ by the men of Troy?<img id="541" contenteditable="false" src="img/noteBut.png" title="id-541" class="annotation"> But if the men called him ‘Astyanax’, isn’t it clear that ‘Skamandrios’ must be what the women called him?
HERM. Probably so.
SOCR. And didn’t Homer also think that the Trojans were wiser than their women?HERM. I suppose he did.
SOCR. So musn’t he have thought that ‘Astyanax’ was a more correct name for the boy than ‘Skamandrios’?
HERM. So it seems.
