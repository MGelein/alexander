See Sedley (2003) 70 on "an established assumption about the origin of language: we owe it to some anonymous nomothetÃªs {italics}.", which might have been "a product of the fifyj-century etymological industry, a large-scale Sophistic enterprise<img id="737" contenteditable="false" src="img/noteBut.png" title="id-737" class="annotation"> of which Plato's Cratylus {italics} is no more than a faint echo. The suggestion has the following basis. Anyone seeking to etymologise the actual word onoma {italics}, was only too likely to link its origin to 'the law', ho nomos {italics, underlining: o nom}, and thus to look fr and emphasise ways in whoc naming is a kind of lawmaking. I suspect, for this reason, that the lost Sophistic discussions of 'correctness of namens' had already come to postulate a role for one or more linguistic nomothetai {italics}, and that that is why Critias, hermogenes and (in due course) Cratylus are all familiar enough with the same assumption to endorse it without question."
